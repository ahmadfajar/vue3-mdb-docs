# Introduction 

::: lead
**Vue MDBootstrap** is a collection of Vue.js UI components and was built from the ground up 
to be easy to learn and use. Our collection of UI components maintain a consistent style throughout 
your application with enough customization options to meet any use-case.
:::


## Why Vue MDBootstrap? 

**Vue MDBootstrap** is an attempt to have Vue3 components with Typescript. At first we just support 
**Bootstrap v5**. Later we saw **TailwindCSS** also becomes more popular and widely used. And now, 
**Vue MDBootstrap** also comes with support for **TailwindCSS v4**. Another goal is to have the 
components written in a simple and readable way for a better developer experience.

### Flexible components

Every component in **Vue MDBootstrap** is built according to the [Google Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/)
specifications and comes with many customization options suitable for most style or design;
even though it’s not Material Design. Our UI components can leverage the world's most popular css
framework - *Bootstrap v5* and *TailwindCSS v4*, which can help you build responsive apps faster 
and mobile friendly.

### It’s free

**Vue MDBootstrap** is an Open Source project available for free under the BSD-3-Clause license. 
Additionally, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahmadfajar/vue-mdbootstrap), 
allowing developers to modify and contribute to its development if they choose to do so.
