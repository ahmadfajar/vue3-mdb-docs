## Important HTML Globals

Bootstrap CSS employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you'll need
to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards
the normalization of cross browser styles. Refer to the following sub-sections for details.

### HTML5 doctype

Bootstrap requires the use of the `HTML5` doctype. Without it, you *may see some funky incomplete
styling*, but including it shouldn't cause any considerable hiccups.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

### Responsive meta tag

Bootstrap developed for mobile first, a strategy in which code optimized for mobile devices
first and then scale the components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering
and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>`.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```

## Browser Support

All major modern browsers.
