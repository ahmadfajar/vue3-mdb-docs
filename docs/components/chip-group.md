# Chip Group

::: lead
**BsChipGroup** extends the **BsChip** component by providing groupable functionality. 
It is used for creating groups of selections using chips.
:::


## Overview

**BsChipGroup** is a collection of **BsChip**. Rather than create multiple `<bs-chip>`, 
itâ€™s better to create single `<bs-chip-group>`. **BsChipGroup** provides **select**
functionality, which will come in handy when working with more chips. The `items` 
property is used as data source to create the chips.
