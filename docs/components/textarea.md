## Overview

**BsTextArea** component mimics the HTML5 `<textarea>` element. This means that you can add 
attributes like `required`, `readonly`, or `disabled` and it will react to them to give 
the best experience. You can also use `v-model` directive to create two-way data bindings 
on the `model-value` property as in `v-model="myText"`. This is useful to control or maintain 
the `model-value` property.
