# Become Our Sponsor

**Vue MDBootstrap** is an [BSD-3-Clause Licensed](https://github.com/ahmadfajar/vue-mdbootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE.md) 
open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort 
needed to maintain and develop new features for the project. This project is 
sustainable thanks to the financial support of our sponsors. 


## How to Sponsor​

Sponsorships can be done via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ahmadfajar). 
Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system. Both monthly-recurring 
sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are 
entitled to logo placements as specified in Sponsorship Tiers.


### Sponsoring as a Business​

If you are using Vue MDBootstrap to build a revenue-generating product, it makes 
business sense to sponsor Vue MDBootstrap's development: it ensures the project 
that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.


### Sponsoring as an Individual​

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using 
Vue MDBootstrap, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying us 
coffee once in a while. We accept sponsorships and donations via 
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ahmadfajar).

You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor Vue MDBootstrap as a business. 
This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact 
on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help 
us much more if you succeed.


## Special

Thank you to our special sponsor. Your support is greatly appreciated.
